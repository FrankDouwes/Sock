Sock - Simple AIR Sockets v1.0
====

(no longer updated/maintained)

Sock – Simple AIR Sockets is an AIR Socket server/client SWC component for AIR Desktop Applications with an XML save function attached to it (in a nutshell). It’s simple to setup but has plenty of optional settings to make very complex communicative structures between multiple (AIR) applications running on multiple, or on a single, computer.
Sock was developed after I spent months dealing with sockets and socket-data on a semi-daily basis, developing a suite of apps that had to share/sync user settings amongst each-other, but also outside the AIR runtime environment, setting up a socket connection isn’t the hardest thing in the world, making them work reliable across multiple apps keeping all data synced correctly is! To avoid this problem in the future I decided to develop a component that would save me a lot of time in the future, the result is Sock!
